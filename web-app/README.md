# Gemini Coin Web App

This is my front end implementation for the coinmixer challenge.

## MVP   

##### This is the basic MVP process:    
**1.** A user opens the app and enters some information about the mix they want to do:       
  **a.** A list of addresses to send the mixed coins to.       
  **b.**(OPTIONAL) The number of transactions they'd like to take place.        
  **c.**(TODO)(OPTIONAL) The max time length to delay transactions by.        
**2.** After submitting, the app displays a unique, random address to send coins to.    
**3.** Once the coins are sent to the address, the UI displays the transactions that the user should see.


## Pages
A list of all the pages in the app.
